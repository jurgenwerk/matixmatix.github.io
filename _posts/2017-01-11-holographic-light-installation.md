A while ago my associates and I at [Formaviva](https://www.facebook.com/Formaviva/) set out to create something visually special to put on the stage for electronic music events that [we host](https://www.residentadvisor.net/promoter.aspx?id=47286). What we had in mind was a visual installation to complement the show of audio brilliance accompanied by mind-provokingly themed messages we carry out on these events.

After searching and brainstorming we came across an example of an installation whose concept we could closely relate to:

</figure>

Installations that mess with our perception and tend to skew the dimensions of space and reality is something that is truly close to us.

We decided to replicate it.

## How It Works

At a first glance this installation may seem like a complicated lightning composition of LED planes, but in fact itâ€™s just a clever demonstration of how a projector emits light throughout space.

The projector is projecting light rays onto the screens from behind. The further we push it away, the larger image it will project onto the screen. What we want to do with this installation is to place semi-transparent screens on the rays' path to catch the projected image in different lengths away from the projector. This way weâ€™ll be able to observe the same image several times, making an illusion of a hologram.

## The Frames

Frames (8 of them) are required to be easily transportable by a car. They are assembled from 32 ðŸŒ² spruce bars, measuring `140 x 2 x 2cm` each.

I had these done at my local carpenter, and he cut them at an angle so they can easily be assembled perpendicularly. Because thatâ€™s how squares should be, right?

I tried to explain to him what project Iâ€™m about to do, but I think I just got a strange look. I promised to him Iâ€™m going to show him once itâ€™s done, so, dear carpenter, I hope youâ€™re reading this now and not think of me as a weirdo anymore.

Now comes the part when we screw these bad boys together. After a visit in the hardware store I came home with a pile of nuts, bolts, washers and steel corners.

Roaming in large hardware stores is really therapeutic. I like to walk around the aisles for hours, imagining how would I use construction and composite materials, sometimes in completely different ways they are meant for.

To support the squares and hold them vertically, simple corner stands were made.

Alright, time for a quick test fit, and then applying black paint. Looking good!

</figure>

Iâ€™m unhappy with my tiny workshop. Itâ€™s so small and cram-full. Canâ€™t wait to get a larger one.

## The Fabric

The next step was to find a textile fabric to stretch over the frames. This material needs a unique property of:

- Capturing enough light so a shape can be seen while projecting an image from the projector,
- Passing enough light through for the light to get projected on the next frame(s).

Sounds like some kind of a semi-transparent cloth could to the job. I paid a visit to the cloth & fabric store and explained what I needed. Needless to say, I got some strange looks there as well. After some searching in their warehouse, they provided me with polyamide mesh fabric, which proved to work fine.

The fabric was streched over frames and attached with pushpins. Hereâ€™s a test fit:

    <a href="/images/projection-post/fabric-2.jpg"><img src="/images/projection-post/fabric-2.jpg"></a>
    <figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>

At this point all the parts were ready for transport and (dis)assembly.

## Animation software

For projection, video clips of simple geometrical shapes work best as they produce the clearest looking holographic silhouettes.

To control the projection and apply various morphing effects to it we used [VDMX](http://vidvox.net), which is a simple yet amazingly capable software that offers a plethora of knobs and whistles. Its parameters were connected to an external midi controller. Thanks Katarina and Aljaz for help on this area.

## On Stage

The image below is showing the assembled installation on the party event stage. Notice the squares are surrounded by vertical bars? This is actually a separate light installation that my friend Aljaz made using LED stripes (and lots of soldering and programming) - [check out his installation here](https://vimeo.com/201412571) - a must see!

We joined both installations and their effects complement each other wonderfully.

## In Action

## The Verdict

There is a lot of room for improvement, especially in the video department and reactivity to dynamics of music.

Nevertheless, it's baffling to experience that a simple structure like this, combined with cleverly projected light, is able to lull the viewer in and out of virtual reality while getting caught between multiple dimensions on the dancefloor.
